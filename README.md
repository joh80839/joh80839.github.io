##Personal Introduction
-The purpose of this project is to create a personal webpage and to develop my HTML, CSS, and Markdown documentation skills. The webpage shows traditional HTML  structure and information about my major, goals, interest, and hobbies. A link to my GitHub account is listed as the final text on the website, which allows you to view the repository and the source code inside. When viewing the source code of the website, you can see the actual HTML code, such as a head box with a link to a CSS style sheet and a body box with H1, H2, and P boxes within it. CSS was used to add color to the website's background, white boxes behind titles, and different fonts to the text, giving the website character.
